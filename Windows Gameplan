Windows Gameplan

---

### README
- **Forensic Questions**: Document any questions or issues you may need to answer during the forensic analysis.

### Initialize Script and Fix Potential Issues
- **Initialize PowerShell Script**: Set up the PowerShell script and resolve any potential issues that could impact its functionality (e.g., reset system policies, correct environment variables, reinitialize Windows Update service, etc.).

### Baselining
- **System State**: Document the initial system state using tools like `Get-ComputerInfo` and `Get-Process` to establish a baseline of processes, services, and registry settings.

### Users & Groups
- **User Management**: Review and secure user accounts and groups to ensure no unauthorized users are present. Use commands like `net user` and `net localgroup`.
- **Password Policies**: Verify that secure password policies are in place (e.g., password complexity, expiration, lockout policies).

### Backdoor & Malware Hunting
- **Malware Detection**: Use Windows Defender, Sysinternals tools (e.g., `Autoruns`, `Process Explorer`), and MRT to scan for malware and backdoors.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Check for potentially malicious scheduled tasks with `schtasks /query`.

### Updates
- **System Updates**: Apply all available Windows updates (`sconfig` on servers, `Get-WindowsUpdateLog`).
- **Reboot**: Reboot the system as needed to apply kernel and critical security updates.

### Package and Service Management
- **Service Review**: Review and disable unnecessary services to reduce the attack surface (`Get-Service`).
- **Program Control**: Uninstall unneeded applications via `Add/Remove Programs` or by using `winget`.

### System Hardening
- **Group Policy Configuration**: Enforce secure policies via Group Policy Management (`gpedit.msc`), restrict removable media, and manage access to critical system settings.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Set up and enforce firewall rules using Windows Defender Firewall.
- **UAC & LSASS Protection**: Ensure User Account Control (UAC) and LSASS protection are enabled.

### Critical Service Security
- **Service Hardening**: Secure essential services like RDP, Remote Assistance, and SMB.
- **RDP Security**: Configure RDP settings to limit access, enforce Network Level Authentication (NLA), and set up event logging.
- **SMB**: Configure SMB settings to encrypt data, disable SMB1 protocol and look for smb1.0 and disable.

### File and Directory Permissions
- **Permissions Management**: Ensure critical directories (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`, user profile directories) have secure permissions.
- **Auditing**: Enable file and folder auditing to monitor access to sensitive files.

### Point Scrounging
- **Additional Security**: Implement any additional security measures (e.g., security logging, event monitoring, encryption of sensitive data).
